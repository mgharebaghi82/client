                from users to enter the network, a very special hardware or a

                certainty of choosing the block generator. Having more
                processors and more memory might raise the chance of the
                generator choosing, it leads to concentration and lack of
                justice though.

                Proof of Patience is a new consensus mechanism to overcome these
                weak points. In this mechanism choosing the block generators
                happens in turn and each node in the network has an equal chance
                of being the next. To do so, the prevailing generator selects a
                random node as the next generator (leader) to create a new block
                and that node cannot be the leader again as long as every other
                node in the network has not created at least one block.

              <br />
              <Typography variant="h5" fontWeight="bold">
                Some points are worth to be mentioned here:
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="h5" style={{ lineHeight: "1.7" }}>
                <b>First</b> of all, everything is completely clear and all the
                network members behold choosing the next leader by the current
                one.
                <b>Second</b>, it is totally fair and no member in the network
                has more chances than the others. <b>Third</b>, no node needs to
                use a special hardware or keep the value in the network due to
                the simplicity in the consensus. Unlike POET consensus
                mechanism, there would be no call for a time computation as each
                node has to wait until all the members create a block. In fact,
                the number of the blocks matters, not the time!
              </Typography>
              <br />
              <Typography variant="h5" fontWeight="bold" color="#0072D8 ">
                A question might arise now that by joining new nodes, would the
                line for choosing the leader get longer and would the members
                have to wait for the newcomers to create a block?
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="h5" style={{ lineHeight: "1.7" }}>
                <b style={{ color: "green" }}>This mechanismâ€™s solution:</b>{" "}
                Each new node to the network has to wait a complete round,
                meaning the new node cannot be the leader until all the members
                have created a block since the newcomerâ€™s arrival. It in fact
                should prove its patience to get into the list of leaders.

              <br />
              <Typography variant="h5" fontWeight="bold" color="#0072D8 ">
                Another possible question: What if the next generator chosen by
                the current one has left the network?
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="h5" style={{ lineHeight: "1.7" }}>
                <b style={{ color: "green" }}>The answer:</b> The existing
                leader would select a new leader and it continues to an online
                leader be found.

              <br />
              <Typography variant="h5" fontWeight="bold" color="#0072D8 ">
                Another question to be asked is on what basis the leader chooses
                the next?
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="h5" style={{ lineHeight: "1.7" }}>
                <b style={{ color: "green" }}>The answer is simple:</b>{" "}
                Randomly! Only once to be a leader would make the fairness in
                the network unaffected for the reason that the existing leader
                will be removed from the queue as soon as they create a block.
              </Typography>
              <br />
              <Typography variant="h5" fontWeight="bold" color="#0072D8 ">
                There is still one important question. Who would choose the
                leader if the prevailing leader has left the network?
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="h5" style={{ lineHeight: "1.7" }}>
                <b style={{ color: "green" }}>In this case,</b> Proof of
                Patience defines the last existing block generator in the
                network. Remember that the agreed-upon node just chooses the new
                leader among the eligible nodes and does not have any more
                chances to create a block.

                Proof of patience has great potential to improve safety,
                effectiveness and stability in blockchain networks. This
                mechanism is at the early stages of development, but is probable
                to be the dominant consensus mechanism in the future.
